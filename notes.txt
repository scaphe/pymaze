Todo
o  Need local controller to re-check pending-action before actually posting it to player on queue - recheck key press
   Maybe each client needs to accept pending-action back, then just as it would apply, if player is the local player, then recheck?
o  Draw floor, then walls, then users to add items during init phase?
o  Ensure that player is not about to move into a square that has something in it
o  Add another 3 players - with different keys to control them
